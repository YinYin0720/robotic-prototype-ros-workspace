# Robotic Prototype – ROS Workspace

This project involves designing and developing a human-robot interaction prototype for the Jupiter Robot—an educational platform built for AI-focused robotics and service robot development.

The program functions as an autonomous receptionist, assuming the Jupiter Robot is connected to a laptop or desktop computer stationed at the front desk of a building entrance.

Using built-in AI algorithms powered by computer vision and speech processing, the robot can:
- Identify and interact with visitors
- Greet guests upon arrival
- Provide informative directions or assistance

Technologies used:
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Ubuntu
- AI modules for vision and speech (NLP and CV)
